# levelup

> A **learning-oriented**, minimal implementation of LevelDB in pure Rust.

This project is **not production-ready**. It aims to:
- Help to understand LSM-tree, WAL, SSTable, compaction, etc.
- Provide clean, readable Rust code as a reference.
- Be compatible with LevelDB's basic API and on-disk format (where practical).

Use it to **level up** my systems programming skills! ðŸš€
